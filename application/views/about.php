        <h1>Hi, I'm Sean</h1>

        <p>I'm a software developer, specializing in creating web applications. I've been interested in writing software since elementary school, and I wrote my first web page in grade 6. It was about Star Wars.</p>

        <h2>Web</h2>

        <p>I'm primarily a web software developer. This means I'm very good at writing powerful, mobile-first websites that do lots of things.</p>

        <h2>User experience</h2>

        <p>I make websites that are highly usable. Usable websites are intuitive to the user, straightforward to browse, and makes difficult tasks obvious. User experience design is the social side of software development.</p>

        <h2>Project management</h2>

        <p>I also do agile project management. That makes collaboration much easier when large problems can be organized and divided into smaller ones. I encourage teams to work better together with modern development tools, and connect developers to the business.</p>

         <p>I am currently employed full time at the University of Calgary, however in my free time I'm available for hire as a freelance web developer or instructor. If you have a project you want to discuss, send me a note.</p>
