        <h1>Hi, I'm Sean</h1>

        <p>I'm a software developer, specializing in creating web applications. I've been interested in writing software since elementary school, and I wrote my first web page in grade 5. It was about Star Wars.</p>

        <h2>Full-stack developer</h2>

        <p>I'm primarily a web software developer. This means I'm very good at writing enterprise grade, mobile-first websites that do lots of things. Full-stack means I'm comfortable with infrastructure, data, back-end technologies, and user interfaces. There is a good blog post about it <a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


        <h2>User experience</h2>

        <p>I make websites that are highly usable. Usable websites are intuitive to the user, straightforward to browse, and makes difficult tasks obvious. User experience design is the social side of software development. This is my favourite part.</p>



        <h2>Project management</h2>

        <p>I also do agile project management as it relates to software projects. That makes collaboration much easier when large problems can be organized and divided into smaller ones. I encourage teams to work better together with modern development tools, and connect developers to the business.</p>



        <h2>Teaching</h2>

        <p>I like teaching web and software development. I have taught in a classroom as an instructor and as a private tutor.</p>
