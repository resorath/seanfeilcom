				<p>beneFIT is a two-woman team of certified personal trainers focusing on middle-aged people looking to get in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The trainers already had a few existing clients, and were looking to expand their online presense, and client base as a result.</p>

						"Small batch fitness" is a trial tagline to emphasise the personal nature of the training in both one-on-one personal training and the small fitness classes that they run.

				<p>beneFIT's online presense started as a simple WordPress website and a few social networking accounts. The original website was nothing more than a pamphlet website which emphasised the company's vision and blog links. A transformation was required to push the products and expertise of the trainers.</p>

				<p>The first step was adding a simple redesign of their front page, and layering in a simple eCommerce platform. I kept WordPress, but modified an existing trendy theme which had all the basic components they needed: mobile-first responsive design, WooCommerce support, and a simple navigation. The whole package came together very quickly, and using WordPress the trainers were already quite familiar with how to maintain their website.</p>

						The beneFIT store was organized as a course catalog with large attractive images. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>Once the WordPress site with course offerings was built, and the trainers trained up on how to add new courses through WooCommerce, next came the integration.</p>

				<p>Moodle, an open-source eLearning system was added in. Some courses came with an online learning component on how to stay active or to review training programs to do at home. Every signup from WooCommerce triggered an automatic registration into the corresponding Moodle course. This also enabled the trainers to create online-only courses to sell with their customized training programs. Users simply log into the beneFIT website with the same account they used to register, and they can follow a link from the "Learn" link at the top of every page to find their course. A custom single-sign on into Moodle brought them into their course without another login.</p>

				<p>The second ongoing integration is with the popular fitness training platform MindBody. Wanting to leverage the community nature of platform to push more registrations, custom integration is being built into the MindBody API to allow both registrations from the beneFIT website, and also allow the online training component to continue to operate from MindBody registrations.</p>

				<p>beneFIT continues to evolve as a business, and the beneFIT website will continue to evolve along with it.</p>
