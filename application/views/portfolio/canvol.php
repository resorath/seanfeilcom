			<div class="portfolio-story">
				<p>CanVol is a charity finder and review concept built as a learning project. My role was to teach a junior high student the fundamentals of web design and development, and the project grew into a fully production web application.</p>


				<p>CanVol attempts to solve the issue of youth not being able to find charities to volunteer for. Often charities don't have roles thought out for youth, so CanVol maintains a directory of youth-friendly charities. Further, it allows youth who have volunteered at these charities in the past to rate their experience.</p>

				<p>Working with local charities, Canvol invites representatives to maintain their own entries in the charity database. This also allows charities to post opportunities that youth can discover through their website. However, charities agree to keep a hands-off approach in the ratings they receive.</p>

				<p>The student also maintains his blog on the site, about his personal experience with charities, featuring a charity each month.</p>

				<p>CanVol has since been handed off to the student to continue to engage with charities and expand the listing himself with the help of his parents and schoolmates.</p>
